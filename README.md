# JLR HVAC Concept

Inspired by [PDXostc's HVAC project](https://github.com/PDXostc/hvac), this is purely a technical and stylistic exercise that is aimed to create a clean and simple HVAC interface. The interface takes design queues from the [Land Rover Discovery Vision Concept](http://www.landroverusa.com/future-vehicles/discovery-vision-concept.html).

## Future enhancements

* Cleaner 'Auto AC' logic
* Heated seat control
